# Smart Attendance System 📱✨

A modern, Flutter-powered attendance management system designed for educational institutions. This system leverages QR codes, location verification, and multiple authentication methods to provide a secure and efficient way to track student attendance.

## 📋 Project Report Information

### Problem Statement
**Target Audience:** Educational institutions (universities, colleges, schools) struggling with traditional attendance tracking. Primary users include professors managing multiple courses, students needing convenient attendance marking, and administrators requiring comprehensive oversight.

**Pain Points:** Traditional attendance systems are inefficient and problematic. Manual roll-call wastes lecture time and is error-prone. Paper-based records are difficult to maintain and analyze. Existing digital solutions lack security, enabling attendance fraud through proxy marking. No reliable verification methods exist to ensure actual student presence. Lack of real-time analytics prevents data-driven decisions about student engagement.

**Solution:** A Flutter-based mobile application that creates a secure, efficient attendance management platform. The system uses multiple authentication methods including time-sensitive QR codes, location verification, and passcode backups to prevent fraud. Role-based interfaces serve professors (QR generation, analytics), students (quick QR scanning with location verification), and administrators (comprehensive oversight). Real-time analytics and detailed reporting enable informed decision-making.

**Nature of Output:** Cross-platform mobile application (Android, iOS, Web) with secure authentication, real-time attendance tracking, analytics dashboards, and reporting tools. Outputs include attendance reports (CSV/PDF), real-time statistics, course-wise analytics, and student performance metrics. Features modern Material Design UI with Supabase backend integration for scalable, secure data management and role-based access control.
